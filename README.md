RAP plots for aviation nowcasting

July 25, 2018 - Initial Build

Right now, the only thing this code does is plot wind speeds and geopotential heights at each pressure level using RAP GRIB data from NCEP. Long-term, I hope to use this code to have some real-time and short-term forecast RAP products for clear air turbulence, mountain turbulence, mountain obscuration, and icing products for use in aviation forecasting. The to-do list is below. Feel free to contact me via my Twitter (@jgodwinWX) if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or requests.

To-Do List:
1. Clear Air Turbulence Products: Ellrod Index, Divergence Tendency, Richardson Number, Turbulent Kinetic Energy, Graphical Turbulence Guidance, and Ellrod-Knox Index.
2. Interpolate information to flight levels instead of pressure levels.
3. Mountain Wave Turbulence
4. Mountain Obscuration
5. Icing
6. Forecast
